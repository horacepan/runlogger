Simple run logger

Logs the date, mileage, duration, and notes about your runs to a csv file for
future data munging.

Example usages:
python runlogger.py -m 5 -t 35:23 -n "hard pace. felt good"
python runlogger.py -t 1:05:23 -n "long run. didnt keep track of distance but probably 8 miles"
python runlogger.py -m 8.3 -n "strong run. didnt have my watch. probably 7min/mile pace"
